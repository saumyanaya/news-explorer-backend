## News Explorer Backened

This stage involves building the back-end for your full-stack application or News Explorer project. You'll set up a Node.js server, create API schemas and models, implement routes and controllers, and manage authentication and authorization with JWT. Additionally, you'll configure logging, deploy the API to a cloud server, and secure it with HTTPS. Finally, you'll connect a domain to your server and ensure the API is accessible publicly. Once completed, you'll submit your work for review and make necessary adjustments based on feedback.
